Sun is going down, time is running out
No one else around but me
Steady losing light, steady losing my mind
Moving shadows and grinding teeth

Without you, there ain't no place for me to hide
Without you, there's no way I can sleep tonight
What I'd do for a little bit of peace and quiet
Without you, I keep
Slipping into bad dreams (dreams)
Where there's no you and I
No sound when I cry
I love you and I need you to set me free
From all of these
Bad dreams (bad dreams)
Waitin' on the other side
No sound when I cry
I love you and I need you to set me free
From all of these, all of these
